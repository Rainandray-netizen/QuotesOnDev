# Quotes On Dev

Quotes On Dev is a quote generator that pulls from a list of quotes. A user may submit new quotes, which will be stored as wordpress posts.

## Installation

Please Ensure you have wordpress properly installed.  Replace the wp-content folder with a new one containing all files in this repository.  You will need to set the theme to Quotes On Dev.

## Technology Used

This Project involved the use of PHP, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Wordpress, Jquery, REST api, and SASS.

## What I learned

This site was a great way to learn to use api's, something I have wanted to learn to use for some time now.  The interaction with wordpress can sometimes be frustrating, especially when custom fields are involved, but overall I think this project works as intented. Be on the lookout for my bonus quote!
